# Welcome to the GitHub Guide by the Career Developement Center at Appalachian State University! 🚀🎓

## Introduction 👋
#### Hello and welcome to the GitHub page managed by the Career Development Center at Appalachian State University. This GitHub page was created to serve as an example for students who would like to display their projects and collaborate with others in the coding community.

### What is GitHub? 🌐
#### GitHub is a platform that provides a collaborative environment for developers to work on projects together, share code, and track changes. It's a valuable tool for showcasing your coding skills and collaborating on projects with fellow developers.

## Creating a Repository 🏗
#### Step 1: Sign in or Sign up 🛠️
If you haven't already, sign in to your GitHub account or create a new one. If you're a student at Appalachian State University, you're in the right place!
#### Step 2: Click the '+' Button 🆕
Look for the '+' button at the top-right corner of the screen. Click it, and select "New Repository." You're on your way!
#### Step 3: Name Your Repository 📛
Give your repository a unique name that represents your project. Feel free to add emojis for a personal touch! 😄
#### Step 4: Description (Optional) 📝
Write a brief description of your project. Let others know what you're building and what makes it special. 📚
#### Step 5: Choose Visibility 👀
Decide if you want your repository to be public, where anyone can see it, or private, so only you and your collaborators can access it.
#### Step 6: Initialize with a README 📂
Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README." This will create a README file (just like this one!) to introduce your project.
#### Step 7: Create Repository 🚀
Click the big green button that says "Create Repository." Your project's home on GitHub is ready!

## Repository Templates: Hello World 👋
#### As part of the Career Development Center's commitment to helping you succeed, we've provided repository templates to get you started quickly. These templates include "Hello World" files that showcase the basics of coding and version control.
#### Clone the Hello World Repository 🧲
Find the "Hello World" repository on this page. Click the green "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.

#### Clone to Your Computer 🖥️
Open your terminal and use the git clone command followed by the URL to clone the "Hello World" repository to your computer.

#### Explore the Files 🕵️‍♀️
Open the project in your code editor to see how it works. You'll find code examples and instructions to guide you.

#### Make It Your Own ✍️
Modify the code, experiment, and add your improvements to the "Hello World" project. This is a safe space to practice and learn!

## Learning Resources: Setting Up Your Terminal 📺
To help you get started with using GitHub and setting up your terminal for version control, we recommend watching this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo). This video provides a step-by-step walkthrough of creating your own repository, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub. It's a great resource to complement what you've learned here!

## Collaboration and Beyond 🤝
GitHub offers advanced features for collaboration, such as branching, pull requests, and code reviews. As you become more comfortable with the platform, don't hesitate to explore these features and expand your coding skills.

You're now equipped with the basics of using GitHub and creating repositories. Remember, GitHub is not only about code; it's also about connecting with a community of passionate developers. Reach out for help, share your knowledge, and enjoy your coding journey! 🎉👩‍💻
